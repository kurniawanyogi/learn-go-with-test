# Learn Go with Test

This repository is a space where you can practice **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** while learning and mastering the **Go programming language** at the same time.

The goal of this repository is to help you:
- Learn Go programming by writing tests and code together.
- Master the principles of **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, which will guide you to write clean, maintainable, and reliable code.
- Understand and apply the full TDD cycle to build high-quality software.

## TDD Cycle

Let's go over the **TDD cycle**:

1. **Write a test**  
   Start by writing a test for the feature or functionality you're about to implement. The test should define the behavior you expect from your code.

2. **Make the compiler pass**  
   After writing the test, write the simplest code possible to make the compiler happy (i.e., to get rid of compilation errors).

3. **Run the test, see that it fails, and check the error message is meaningful**  
   Run the test to see that it fails. This is expected at this stage. Ensure the error message is meaningful and gives you a clear understanding of what's wrong.

4. **Write enough code to make the test pass**  
   Now, write just enough code to make the test pass. The goal is to only implement the feature necessary for the test to pass. Avoid over-engineering.

5. **Refactor**  
   Once the test passes, clean up and refactor the code if needed. The refactoring step should improve code readability, maintainability, and efficiency without changing the behavior.

6. **Repeat the cycle**  
   Continue with the cycle: write new tests, implement the code, refactor, and repeat. Each small step should improve both your code and understanding of Go and TDD.

## Why TDD with Go?

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** helps ensure that your code works as expected from the beginning. It emphasizes writing tests before implementation, which results in better-designed and more reliable code.

- **Go** is a simple, fast, and efficient programming language, and practicing TDD while learning Go will help you develop solid programming practices early on.

- By learning Go through TDD, you will also improve your debugging and problem-solving skills, as you will always have a set of tests to verify your codeâ€™s behavior.
